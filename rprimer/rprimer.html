  <!--<p>I am now working on an updated version of this book in my spare time.  I will distribute updates chapter 
	by chapter for now.</p> -->
  <p>I have also retitled the book simply <i>The R Primer</i> (i.e., I dropped the &quot;Stat 390&quot;) to 
	reflect the fact that the book is being used for classes other than Stat 390.</p> 
  <p><b>Instructors:</b> You are welcome to use this book in your courses. My only request is that you link 
	to this site rather than to a local copy on your server.
	This will ensure you and your students always have access to the latest version <i>and</i> will (hopefully)
	cut down on the number of old versions cached by search engines.</p>
